      blurb: >
        This page serves as a repository of links to the various tools you have access to as an administrative user. While
        you use these, remember that the data in them is usually admin- or moderator-only, and should likely not be shared
        with anyone outside of those teams.
    email_being_sent: 'Your email is being sent.'
    email_moderators_blurb: >
      This tool allows you to send to the moderators' email distribution list, which will reach any current moderator
      who is subscribed to it. Use sparingly and non-spammily. Your email will be sent in both HTML (formatted)
      and plain text (unformatted) forms, so format in a way that will be legible when Markdown is removed.
    email_all_blurb: >
      This tool sends email to ALL registered users with a valid email address. Use very very rarely, usually only for
      organisation-wide changes like privacy policy or TOS changes. Format in a way that will be legible when Markdown
      is removed.
    error_search_uuid: 'Search for an error UUID'
    privileges_blurb: >
      Here you can define the reputation required to gain each available privilege. Click on a value to edit it.
    email_query_blurb: >
      This tool allows you to query for a user by their email address. If a user is found, you will be shown a list of
      their profiles on communities on which you are an admin.
