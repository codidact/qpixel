          <p>Other users should be able to understand your problems and ideally be able to reproduce the issue.</p>
          <p>This is how the explanation could look for your dragon Martha.</p>
          <blockquote class="h-ff-code">Martha is a Hot Red Firebreather, and is five and a half feet long at about a year old (still pretty young, since dragons are only fully grown at three). I've had her for about three months now. She's generally very well-behaved - never breathing fire inside the house and not fighting with my neighbor's old Sapphire Blue Waterspouter. However, every time she sees my (solitary) sheep, she chases him around and bothers him, and it's really not good for the sheep.</blockquote>

          <p>When you ask a question, we generally expect you to have done some research and to have tried to solve the issue by yourself.</p>
          <p>Add a short summary of your prior efforts and how they failed. Help the community help you by sharing what you already know, so they know where to start and they don't waste time suggesting things you've already tried.</p>

          <p>Now you're almost finished.</p>
          <p>In some cases, you might want to add some restrictions, what you definitely do not want to do. This helps answerers focus on what you really need.</p>
          <p>For example, you might not want to tickle the dragon:</p>
          <blockquote class="h-ff-code">I do not want to use any training methods that involve pain or restricting the dragon in any way, and I'm not looking to do anything to the sheep. I'm pretty experienced in training dragons, but I've never had to deal with this situation before.</blockquote>

          <p>Good question titles include neither too much nor too little information. They don't have to tell everything your question includes, but they shouldn't be just a general summary of the related topics (that's what tags are for, to which we'll come a bit later). The title can, but doesn't have to be, a question.</p>
          <p>For example, the title "Dragon vs Sheep" is not good for our current question and neither is "Stop cute one year old dragon from eating my sheep without painting them blue or restraining the dragon". Instead, use something like this:</p>
