Hi <%= @user&.username %>,

Re: Your two-factor authentication backup code


You're receiving this email because you have two-factor authentication enabled on your Codidact network account. We've
recently added backup codes for every account using 2FA, so that you can still log in if you lose access to your
authenticator app.

Your backup code can be found in your user account settings, under Two-Factor Authentication settings. Please save it
somewhere safe. Please note that logging in using this backup code will disable 2FA on your account so that you can
reconfigure it using a new app or device &mdash; this will also reset your backup code.

Thanks,
The Codidact Team
