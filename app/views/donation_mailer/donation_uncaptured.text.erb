Your donation is unfinished, <%= @name %>
-----------------------------<%= '-' * @name.size %>
<% end %>

You started the process to make a donation of <%= number_to_currency(@amount, unit: @symbol) %>, but left off before finishing up.

We want to make sure that everything's okay. If you just changed your mind, that's absolutely fine! We're not here
to push. If you ran into problems, however, please let us know if we can help â€” you can reply to this email to
reach us at <%= message.reply_to %>, or you can post on our Meta site (https://meta.codidact.com/), and someone will
lend a hand.

Whatever happened, thanks for thinking of us!

Thanks and see you around,
The Codidact Team
