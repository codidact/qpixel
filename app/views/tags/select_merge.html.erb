<h1 class="has-margin-0 has-margin-top-4">Merge tag into <%= @tag.name %></h1>
<p>
  You can select a tag here to merge it into this tag. All of the posts that have the tag you select will have it
  removed and replaced with this tag, and the selected tag will be deleted. Any children of the selected tag will
  not be deleted, but will revert to not having a parent. Sad face.

<div class="notice is-danger">
  <h4><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Destructive action</h4>
  <p>
    Merging tags is a <strong>destructive action</strong>, meaning that once done it cannot be reversed. If you pick
    the wrong tag here and confirm it, not even a developer will be able to undo the merge.
