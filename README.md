# QPixel [![CircleCI Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/codidact/qpixel.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/codidact/qpixel) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/codidact/qpixel/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/codidact/qpixel) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/237078806.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/237078806)
Rails-based version of our core software. Currently under active development towards MVP.

## Installation
These instructions are assuming you already have a Unix environment available with Ruby and Bundler installed. WSL should work as well,
but Windows is unlikely to.

If you don't already have Ruby installed, use [RVM](https://rvm.io/) or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation) to install
it before following these instructions.

### Install prerequisites

For Linux:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc
sudo apt install make
sudo apt install libmysqlclient-dev
sudo apt install autoconf bison build-essential libssl-dev libyaml-dev libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm-dev
sudo apt install mysql-server
```

For Mac:

```
xcode-select --install
brew install mysql bison openssl mysql-client
bundle config --global build.mysql2 --with-opt-dir="$(brew --prefix openssl)"
```

### Install JS runtime
If you already have Node.JS installed, you can skip this step. If not, [download and install it](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Install Redis
If you haven't already got it, [download and install Redis](https://redis.io/download).

### Install Imagemagick

If you haven't already installed Imagemagick, you'll need to [install it for
your system][0].

### Download QPixel
Clone the repository and `cd` into the directory:

    git clone https://github.com/codidact/qpixel
    cd qpixel

### Configure database connection
If you weren't asked to set the root MySQL user password during `mysql-server` installation, the installation is likely to be using
Unix authentication instead. You'll need to sign into the MySQL server with `sudo mysql -u root` and create a new database user for QPixel:

```sql
CREATE USER qpixel@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'choose_a_password_here';
GRANT ALL ON qpixel_dev.* TO qpixel@localhost;
GRANT ALL ON qpixel_test.* TO qpixel@localhost;
GRANT ALL ON qpixel.* TO qpixel@localhost;
```

Copy `config/database.sample.yml` to `config/database.yml` and fill in the correct host, username, and password for your environment.
If you've followed these instructions (i.e. you have installed MySQL locally), the correct host is `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.

You'll also need to fill in details for the Redis connection. If you've followed these instructions, the sample file should already
contain the correct values for you, but if you've customised your setup you'll need to correct them.

### Set up QPixel
Install gems:

    bundle install

Set up the database:

    rails db:create
    rails db:schema:load
    rails r db/scripts/create_tags_path_view.rb
    rails db:migrate

Â You'll need to create a Community record and purge the Rails cache before you can seed the database. In a Rails console (`rails c`), run:

```ruby
Community.create(name: 'Dev Community', host: 'localhost:3000')
Rails.cache.clear
```
Then seed the database:

    $ rails db:seed
    Category: Created 2, skipped 0
    [...]

Run the server!

    rails s


You can create the first user account in the application, which should be running at http://localhost:3000/. To upgrade the user account
to an admin account, run `rails c` for a console, followed by:

```ruby
User.last.update(confirmed_at: DateTime.now, is_global_admin: true)
```
