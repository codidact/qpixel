<h1>$EDIT-Organization-Name Accessibility Statement</h1>

<!--- Edit as applicable for your organization -->

Sharing information and being part of a community are the two fundamental goals of the Codidact Project. Everyone deserves access to information and to be a part of a community, and with that in mind,  the Codidact Foundation is committed to accessibility in all areas of the Codidact Project.

<h2>Who is responsible for accessibility?</h2>

Accessibility is the responsibility of everyone, from the people writing posts to the people working on the website. However, the chief person responsible for accessibility in the $EDIT-Organization-Name is $Edit-Accessibility-Officer. Questions about $EDIT-Organization-Name's accessibility can be directed to $EDIT-email.

<h2>I'm encountering an accessibility problem with the QPixel software, what do I do?</h2>

Please report any accessibility problems you have on <a href="https://meta.codidact.com">Codidact Meta</a>, using the [bug] and [accessibility] tags. That makes sure that the Codidact developers are aware of the problem, and they'll do their best to fix it as soon as reasonably possible with their available resources.

<h2>Technical details: QPixel Accessibility Policy</h2>

This Accessibility Policy outlines the technical details of the commitment to accessibility for sites running the QPixel software and sets expectations for what is in scope of that commitment.

<h3>The $EDIT-Organization-Name Network</h3>

<!--- edit with your specific details --->

The platform that the Network runs on, known as QPixel, should meet both the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 and the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 standards at the AA conformance level.

Since the platform is open-source and volunteer operated, setting strict timetables isn't realistic. However, new changes to the platform should be made with these standards in mind, including using Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) features.

<h3>User-contributed content</h3>

The $EDIT-Organization-Name encourages all people contributing posts, such as questions, answers, and articles, to make their posts accessible. This is done via system reminders, such as a warning when posting images without alt text, and via other users editing those posts to be more accessible.

An in-depth guide to creating accessible posts is available in the help center.

<h3>$EDIT other sites</h3>

<!-- edit with any other sites controlled by your organization -->
