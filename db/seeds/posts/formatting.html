Codidact uses the [CommonMark implementation](https://commonmark.org) of Markdown for formatting posts.

## Italics
You can *italicize* a word by placing a single asterisk (`*`) or single underscore (`_`) around a word. Either `*Codidact*` or `_Codidact_` will render as *Codidact*.

## Bold
You can **bold** a word by placing a double asterisk or double underscore around that word. Either `**Codidact**` or `__Codidact__` will render as **Codidact**.

## Monospace / code formatting
To make a word monospace, you can surround it with a single backtick (`` ` ``). This is generally used for code formatting. (Some people use this for emphasis. Don't do that! Screen readers will read out words formatted as code character by character - use *italics* or **bold** for emphasis instead.)

To mark several lines as code, you can use a code fence. This is three backticks on a newline both on top and at the bottom of your lines of code. Don't use this for quotes - see below for guidance on quote formatting.

## Links
You can generate a link using one of two methods. One way is to encase your link text in square brackets (`[ ]`) and then the target URL in parentheses (`( )`). `[Codidact](https://codidact.org)` will render as [Codidact](https://codidact.org).

You can also format a link with the inline text being `[Codidact][1]`, and then at the bottom of the post include the URL with the format `[1]: https://codidact.org`. This will look something like this:

```
You can check out [Codidact][1]
for an open-source,
community-oriented Q&A platform!

[1]: https://codidact.org
```

Which will render like this:

> You can check out [Codidact](https://codidact.org) for an open-source, community-oriented Q&A platform!

If you'd like to include rollover text for your link, you can put your text, surrounded by quote marks (`"`), into the URL of your link. For instance, `[Codidact](https://codidact.org "The open-source Q&A platform")` will create a link with `The open-source Q&A platform` as the rollover text.

## Blockquotes
When quoting text from somewhere else, you can use a blockquote to signify that this is not your original text, but a quote from somewhere else. Put a greater than symbol (`>`), followed by a space, before a paragraph to mark that quote as a blockquote. For instance, `> This is a blockquote!` will render as a quote:

> This is a blockquote!

If you want to include a second paragraph as part of the same quote, you have to include another `>` before each line, like this:

```
> This is a blockquote!
>
> This is part of the same quote!
```

This will render as a single blockquote:

> This is a blockquote!
>
> This is part of the same quote!

See also the [citation and referencing help](/help/referencing) for guidelines on how to properly reference different quotes from various places.

## Images
Embedding images in a post is very similar to the formatting for links (detailed above). The format `![alt text](image URL)` will embed an image in your post. Please remember to [write alt text for your image](/help/alt-text)! Codidact allows you to upload an image directly, or you can embed an external image from image hosting sites such as Imgur.

## Lists
You can generate either an ordered list or a bullet list. For a bullet list, you can use either `*` or `-` to create your list.

```
* List item one
* List item two
```

This will render like this:

> - List item one
> - List item two

If you want to create a numbered list, use `1.`, `2.`, etc instead of `*` or `-`. Note that the exact number you use, in most cases, is irrelevant - after the first number that you use, no matter what number you put in, Codidact will automatically number it in order. For instance, if you create a list and type `1. List item #1` for the first line, then `3. List item #2` for the second line, Codidact will automatically render the `3.` as a `2.`. If you begin your list at any other number, such as your first list item is numbered `5.`, Codidact will continue from that number onwards (with the next number automatically rendering as `6.`).

## Horizontal line
You can use a horizontal line for separating sections of your post. Use `---` on its own line to generate a horizontal line.

## Headings
You can include a heading in your post. Using a single hash symbol (`#`) before a line of your post will create a large heading, while adding another will create a slightly smaller heading (up to six different heading sizes).

```
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

###### Heading 6
```

> # Heading 1
>
> ## Heading 2
>
> ###### Heading 6

## Footnotes
To include a footnote in your post, you can use the syntax `[^1]`. In your main text, include `Text[^1] and more text`, and at the bottom (where you want to include your footnote), place a line resembling `[^1]: footnote text`.
